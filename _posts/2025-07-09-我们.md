最近听到一首[好听的歌](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=18861353&userid=2539497),   
歌词很优美,  
或许里面有某种隐喻。

If God had a name, what would it be?    
And would you call it to His face.    
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?    
What would you ask if you had just one question?    
Yeah, yeah, God is Great.    
Yeah, yeah, God is Good.    
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.    
What if God was one of us?     
Just a slob like one of us?     
Just a stranger on a bus.     
Trying to make His way home.    

If God had a face, what would it look like?    
And would you want to see.    
If seeing meant that you would have to believe.      
In things like heaven and in Jesus.    
And the Saints and all the Prophets.    

Yeah, yeah, God is Great.    
Yeah, yeah, God is Good.    
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.    
What if God was one of us?    
Just a slob like one of us?    
Just a stranger on a bus.    
Trying to make His way home.    
Back up to heaven all alone.    
Nobody callin' on the phone.    
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome.
